# Bootstrap 3 grid
> Bootstrap Grid v3.3.7 (Suport IE 8 with html5shiv and respond)

## How to use npm tasks (This step is optional) 

1. Download the repository
2. Install dependencies (npm install)

**Task listing**
- npm run dev (converts scss to css)
- npm run build (css compressed)

## Benefits
- Usually I use this grid to support older browsers, for example IE 8.
- Using the structure in scss, we can use the semantic grid, taking advantage of the mixins.

## Questions
If you have any difficulty using the Gulp Boilerplate or would like some aspect of the current configuration, open an [issue](https://github.com/theandersonn/bootstrap-3-grid/issues/new) and explain your difficulty.
